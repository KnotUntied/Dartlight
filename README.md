# Dartlight
It's for now, a fork of the official dart highlight json to work with sublime text. Some minor changes were made to work as a tmLanguage file.

## Installation

Once you have [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) installed, follow
these instructions to install Dartlight for Sublime Text:

- Open the command palette:

  Operating System  | Keyboard Shortcut
  ----------------  | -----------------
  Linux             | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>
  OS X              | <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> 
  Windows           | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>

- Type 'install'
- Select **Package Control: Install Package**
- Type 'dartlight'
- Select **Dartlight**

You may need to restart Sublime Text
before you can start using all the features
in the Dartlight plugin.
